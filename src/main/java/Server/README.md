Test Plan

The focus of our tests

Our tests focus on the domain code of the project.
* Tests to assert that our world generates obstacles and pits
  as expected
* Tests to assert that the methods in our Obstacle
  class and pit class were as intended
* We assert that our response functions are
  returning the correct strings

To run the tests with Maven, run:

mvn test

in the root of the repository

Expectations:
* We expect that our world generates a set amount of pits and obstacles
* We expect our obstacles to behave in a certain way
* We expect our pits to behave in a certain way
* We expect to be returned with pre-defined response strings
